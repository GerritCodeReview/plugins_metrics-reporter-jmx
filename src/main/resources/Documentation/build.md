Build
=====

This plugin is built with Bazel.  To install Bazel, follow
the instruction on: https://www.bazel.io/versions/master/docs/install.html.

Two build modes are supported:
* Standalone
* In Gerrit tree

Standalone build mode is recommended, as this mode doesn't require local Gerrit
tree to exist.

# Build standalone

To build the plugin, issue the following command:

```
  bazel build @PLUGIN@.jar
```

The output is created in

```
  bazel-bin/@PLUGIN@.jar
```

To package the plugin sources run:

```
  bazel build lib@PLUGIN@__plugin-src.jar
```

The output is created in:

```
  bazel-bin/lib@PLUGIN@__plugin-src.jar
```

To execute the tests run:

```
  bazel test //...
```

This project can be imported into the Eclipse IDE:

```
  ./tools/eclipse/project.sh
```

## Build in Gerrit tree

Clone (or link) this plugin to the `plugins` directory of Gerrit's
source tree, and issue the command:

```
  git clone https://gerrit.googlesource.com/gerrit
  git clone https://gerrit.googlesource.com/plugins/@PLUGIN@
  cd gerrit/plugins
  ln -s ../../@PLUGIN@ .

Put the external dependency Bazel build file into the Gerrit /plugins
directory, replacing the existing empty one.

```
  cd gerrit/plugins
  rm external_plugin_deps.bzl

```

From Gerrit source tree issue the command:

```
